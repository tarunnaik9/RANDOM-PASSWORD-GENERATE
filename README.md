# RANDOM-PASSWORD-GENERATE

Welcome to the Random Password Generator! This web-based application is designed to help users create strong and secure passwords by combining letters, numbers, and special characters. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project aims to enhance my front-end development skills and improve understanding of dynamic web functionality.


# HOW TO USE


  1. Type in password length.

  2. Select type of password required (can also generate pins if you select only numbers). 

  3. Generate password. 

   All passwords are generated on your browser so nothing is stored online, you're the only one who has knowledge of the generated password.
